# Job Seeker

A modern React/Next.js web portal designed to enhance the job search experience. Unlike typical job boards, this project introduces several unique, user-focused features aimed at improving usability and transparency.

> **Note:**  
> This project (and its documentation) is a work in progress. Core website functionality is still under early stages of development.
> Until backend is implemented, the UI shows example data.

## Key Features

- **Upper Salary Limit Filtering**  
    Easily filter out job offers above a specified salary capâ€”especially helpful for less experienced applicants. This addresses the common issue where employers omit certain form fields, making traditional filtering unreliable.

- **Offer Archiving**  
    Company profiles display both active and archived job offers. This gives applicants insight into a company's hiring history and frequency, helping them make more informed decisions.

- **Keyword Aliases**  
    Job titles often vary between companies. By allowing companies to add keyword aliases, offers become more discoverable, ensuring applicants don't miss relevant positions due to naming differences.

- **Applicant Feedback**  
    After the selection process, applicants can voluntarily provide a numerical rating of their experience with the company. This feedback helps future applicants gauge the quality of the recruitment process.
